ABR_server
==========

QT (c++) project: Server running on PC.

This server can receive connections from multiple phones and display video feedback and sensory information.
It can also be used to control remotely robots.

- start server on PC
- connect Android client (ABR_client) to the server using the IP address of server (port 9000).
- once connected, you should see an Android icon on the server GUI.
- right click on it to open a window from which you can start/stop the camera, sensors and IOIO.

!!! ON GOING PROGRESS !!!
------------------------

Software still needs debugging, comments, optimization...


Requirements
------------
- works on Windows 7, Mac OS X, Linux Ubuntu
- QT libraries 4.7.1 (should work for versions < 5.0)
- I also recommand using QT Creator (IDE) to open the project if you need to change the GUI.
Both Qt libraries and Qt Creator can be downloaded in one package here: http://qt-project.org/downloads
